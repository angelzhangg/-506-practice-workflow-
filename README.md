# -506-practice-workflow-
This is a primer for 504/507 Fall semester classes to practice a basic development workflow

Explanation of code:
The code imports the pandas library as pd and numpy as np.
A number variable (numb_variable) is assigned 10
A string variable (string_variable) is assigned the string "hello world".
A dictionary variable (my_dict) is created with three key-value pairs, including a list and a nested dictionary.
The printed output should be 10, hello world and all the dictionary pares

For the function, I gave it the function name analyze_bmi. The two variables to calculate bmi are weight and height. I gave it some parameters and made the height to be 175m and the weight to be 70kg. The return value would be categorized into underweight, normal, or overweight.
